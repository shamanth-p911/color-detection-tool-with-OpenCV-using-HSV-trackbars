Real-Time Color Detection with OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time color detection using OpenCV.  
It provides interactive **trackbars** to adjust HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) ranges, allowing you to filter and highlight objects of a specific color in your webcam feed.

 Features
- Live webcam feed with real-time processing.  
- Adjustable HSV ranges using trackbars.  
- Color masking to isolate and display chosen colors.  
- Useful for object tracking, computer vision experiments, and robotics.
Requirements
- Python 3.96 
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
Install dependencies:
  bash
\\pip install opencv-python numpy
